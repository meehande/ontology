# Ontology

Given an input csv containing an ontology with relationships `is_instance`, `is_subclass`, `has_attribute`, use `neo4j` to create a graph of the relationships and subsequently the queries to answer questions like "Does x have y attribute?", "Is x a subclass of y", "Is x an instance of y".
